# nikdom/docker-cups-airprint

-----------------------

*This forks quadportnick/cups-airprint and adds the foo2zjs printer driver.*
The image can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/nikdom/docker-cups-airprint).

-----------------------

This Ubuntu-based Docker image runs a CUPS instance that is meant as an AirPrint relay for printers that are already on the network but not AirPrint capable. I'm using it on a Synology NAS because the built in server doesn't work properly with my printers. The local Avahi will be utilized for advertising the printers on the network.

This is also an excuse to dip my toes into GitHub/Docker more, so why not? Hopefully someone else finds this useful.

## Prereqs
* No other printers should be shared under Control Panel>External Devices>Printer so that the DSM's CUPS is not running. 
* `Enable Bonjour service discovery` needs to be marked under Control Panel>Network>DSM Settings 

## Configuration

### Volumes:
* `/config`: where the persistent printer configs will be stored
* `/services`: where the Avahi service files will be generated

### Variables:
* `CUPSADMIN`: the CUPS admin user you want created
* `CUPSPASSWORD`: the password for the CUPS admin user

### Ports:
* `631`: the TCP port for CUPS must be exposed

## Using
CUPS will be configurable at http://[diskstation]:631 using the CUPSADMIN/CUPSPASSWORD when you do something administrative.

If the `/services` volume isn't mapping to `/etc/avahi/services` then you will have to manually copy the .service files to that path at the command line.

## Notes
* CUPS doesn't write out `printers.conf` immediately when making changes even though they're live in CUPS. Therefore it will take a few moments before the services files update
* Don't stop the container immediately if you intend to have a persistent configuration for this same reason
